# BRemote
Simple Android app to control mouse pointer.

Please keep in mind that, this simple project (also frogwine/BRemote.desktop) has lots of rework. 
Some of them i remember to do:

-The Android app doesn't find target computer automatically. If you want to test it, you need to put your computer's local IP in 
BRemote.app.src.main.java.com.fwsoftware.bremote.MainActivity.java.socketIP.

-Button titles are not English.

-Text input simply does that send the text message and pressing enter key request.
